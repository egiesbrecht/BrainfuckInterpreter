#a brainfuck interpreter

##What is this?
This is a REALLY simple brainfuck interpreter that can either interpret a .bf file or direct input.

##Why?
To be honnest, I was just bored. This was a one-evening-project, so don't except any fancy features or support of any kind.

##How to use
The main method can take one argument, the file that will be executed. If none argument is given the program takes an input from the console.
If you want, you can't build a jar file of this and use like java -jar brainfuck.jar *TheFileToInterpret.bf* or just java -jar brainfuck.jar

Do whatever you want.
