# BrainfuckInterpreter

## What is this?
This is a simple brainfuck interpreter.

## Why?
To be honnest, I was just bored. This was a one-evening-project, so don't expect anything fancy.

## How to use?
The main method in src/interpreter/Interpreter.java accepts one argument, the .bf file that should be executed.
If no argument is given, the program takes the input-code from the console.
If you want, you can wrap this whole thing into a .jar file and use it like *java -jar build-2022-01-12.jar \*TheBrainfuckFileToExecute.bf*\*.
To use a file as an input is, as I already said, optional. Please note that the build-xxxx-xx-xx files aren't always up to date.
Every output of your brainfuck-code will directly be printed into the console.

## Why should I use this?
I have no idea.
